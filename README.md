## 🚀 About Me

I'm Kirill — a Munich-based Cloud and DevOps consultant, author, speaker, and founder of [mkdev.me](https://mkdev.me). For the past 15+ years, I’ve helped companies — from startups to global enterprises — scale, secure, and stabilize their infrastructure, reduce cloud bills, and build platforms that developers actually enjoy using.

💼 I’ve worked with organizations like **Babbel**, **Allianz**, **Kaia Health**, **Payback**, and **Deutsche Bank**, leading cloud transformations, implementing GitOps platforms, and mentoring teams on cloud-native technologies.

🧠 I'm obsessed with infrastructure as code, platform security, and cost-efficiency — but always with a practical, human-first approach.

## 🎧 I speak and podcast too

🎙 I co-host [DevOps Accents](https://mkdev.me/podcast), where we talk about DevOps, cloud, startups, and career paths in tech — without fluff or buzzwords.

🎤 I’ve spoken at conferences about Kubernetes and platform thinking, and published [technical articles](https://mkdev.me/mentors/fodoj/posts), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC33pBiUW51-InqrLd0BmhMQ), and [courses](https://www.udemy.com/user/mkdev/) — mostly to help others avoid the mistakes I already made.
